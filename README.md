# Laplace-transform-inversion
Implementation of three different methods for the inversion of Laplace transform. 

Three methods for the inversion of LT based on differen principles are implemented. 
Our specific objective in this context is to apply it to the LT of probability distributions
that can be expressed in terms of their LT. Hence the methods are demonstrated on two examples 
including the transforms of some known probabiliy distributions.
